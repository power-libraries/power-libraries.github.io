Power Libraries is a small project to collect some repeatedly needed or 
otherwise useful Java 8 classes in a collection of tiny libraries.

# <span class="before-h1">&#x27a3;</span>[IO Power]({{< ref "iopower.md" >}})
IO Power is the first and really tiny library of the Power Libraries. 
It contains some simple helper method for opening Input- and Outputstreams. 
The main purpose of IO Power is to make opening streams, readers and writers 
less cluttered and simple to understand.
